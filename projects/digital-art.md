In my Ceramics class in high school, students maintained a notebook of illustrations. I used mine to sketch projects, take notes, and create drawings based on a list of topics the teacher provided. For example, topic #6 is a place outside my home, and topic #63 is a Maneki Neko (Lucky Cat) in my style. 

### What does this project tell you about me?

Problem: I have trouble sketching and erasing. Solution: I drew online. Problem-solver identified! Jokes aside, in this project I learned how to navigate Google Draw and drew some designs I am proud of. In future projects, I would like to apply these skills to make visually appealing web pages.
