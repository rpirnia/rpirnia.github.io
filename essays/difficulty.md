I am interested in team-oriented development, project planning, and bringing ideas to life. Some videos I have watched on software engineering advise newbies like myself to develop my skills in problem solving. While exploring code is essential, I also need to focus on honing my problem-solving skills. That is why I have to admit I am slightly looking forward to the Workouts of the Day (WODs) in my ICS 314 class. 

## Coding workouts for the win

You might be wondering what WODs are. Well, let me tell you! The ICS 314: Software Engineering I class I am taking uses daily coding workouts to assess our understanding of the current module. Recently, we have been developing a professional persona and learning basic Typescript. Though it is worrying that performing poorly on the WOD can negatively impact our grade, I cannot hide that I am a little enthusiastic about testing my skills. 

## Communication, please!

One skill I want to develop is my communication. I understand now that my working well with others is just as important as my technical skills. Being able to clearly express thoughts and actively listen to others is a necessary habit. Beyond just working with a team, good communication helps when conveying project information and capabilities to others that are not involved in the technical aspect of the project. It is a good ability that will help in the future. 

## Questions are part of the learning process

I also want to cultivate the confidence to ask questions when I do not understand something. One software engineer I admire, Dave Farley, emphasizes this mindset: “It takes a certain amount of self-confidence to ask questions. The truth though is that the more that you know, the more that you know that you don’t know enough.”  This resonates with me because it shows that questions are not a sign of weakness but rather a chance for growth.

## Looking ahead

In short, I am excited to develop my technical knowledge, teamwork skills, and communication ability! I will do this by studying course material thoroughly and taking on projects, and becoming an active participant in my university. I plan to seek out opportunities for real-world experience such as clubs, organizations, and internships. Let’s become well-rounded learners together!
